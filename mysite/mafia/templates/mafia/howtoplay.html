	<h1>How to play</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Mafia is a game of deception. At the beginning of the game, a small percentage of the players will be chosen to be part of the Mafia. They will know each other, but none of the other players will know who was chosen. The goal as <b>mafia</b> is to kill off villagers until the mafia comprise a majority of the living players. As <b>town</b>, you must use your powers of deduction and interrogation to figure out who the mafia are, and vote them out of the village. The gameplay alternates between two phases, day and night. The mafia (and other special roles) do their actions during the night phase, when the other players have their heads down. Discussion and lynching happens during the day phase.</p>

	<p>Many times, mafia is played with variations in the setup, which include special roles or rules to make the interactions more dynamic and interesting. There are also variations in the way voting and moderating is done, which you can read about in our <a href="{% url 'ruleset' %}">rulesets page.</a> This section will instead help you understand what mindset you need to be in as a player on either side, and things you can do to accomplish your team's goals.</p>
